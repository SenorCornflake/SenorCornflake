My name is Baker Khan. I'm 16 years old and I'm a mediocre programmer. I like linux and I especially like configuring it.
I'm currently learning to make wordpress websites.

I haven't figured out git properly yet. Other than `git add/commit/push` I know nothing.
Things like branches, pulls, merges and anything else git or github related I haven't really needed to learn so I may be a bad collaborator.
